        Iâ€™ve been busy working on my little corner of the internet for quite a
        while so thank you for stopping by!

        If you've been here before the site may look unchanged but I do update
        it every so often utilising new skills that I learn. Currently it's a
        React app written in Typescript, on the Next.js framework and styled
        using SASS.

          <h3>My experience</h3>
          <Coding />
          <p>
            I've worked in a variety of sectors including retail, travel and
            publishing and have been developing professionally for 10+ years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that time, I've been lucky to work for some notable companies
            including Selfridges, Disney, Charlotte Tilbury, The Times and most
            recently BT where I joined as a Lead Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also worked on many projects from CRO initiatives to improving
            web performance, to building component libraries.
